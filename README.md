# A-B-testing
this testing is done without using hypothesis. if you see the code file you will get to know only using visuals and plots are use in this testing .
this testing is done on basis of Control campaign and Test campaign.
Initially,  i have two dataset files control data and test data. 
Data preparation : we given the new column names to column in both data files and checked the null values in both dataset. 
The dataset of the control campaign has missing values in a row.fill in these missing values by the mean value of each column
Now i created a new Dataset by merging the two data i.e. control data and test data.
